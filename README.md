# ICTesterDigital
This project introduces an IC tester with LCD display functionality implemented using embedded C programming.

The system is designed to test various integrated circuits (ICs) commonly used in digital electronics, including 
AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and NOT gates. 

The hardware setup includes an 8051-microcontroller interfaced with a 16x2 LCD display and input/output ports.

The tester evaluates ICs by applying different input combinations and analyzing the output responses.

Through a series of predefined tests, the system determines whether the IC under test is functioning correctly or not. 

Results are displayed on the LCD screen, providing immediate feedback to the user. 

The versatility and simplicity of the system make it a valuable tool for electronics enthusiasts and professionals alike.
